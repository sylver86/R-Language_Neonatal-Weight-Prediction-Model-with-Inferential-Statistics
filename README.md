üéØ **Project Objective:**

This project aims to develop a robust statistical model to predict neonatal weight using a dataset from three hospitals. The focus is on analyzing various maternal and neonatal variables to assess their influence on newborn weight, with particular attention to the impact of maternal smoking.

## Key Achievements

üîç **Data Mastery:**
  - Utilized a comprehensive dataset of 2500 newborns, enhancing understanding of key factors influencing neonatal weight.
  - Executed meticulous data cleaning and verification to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.

üåü **Challenging Task Conquered:**
  - Developed predictive models incorporating multiple variables that significantly affect neonatal outcomes.
  - Addressed complex statistical challenges, such as nonlinear relationships and interactions between variables.

üí° **Innovative Approaches:**
  - Employed advanced inferential statistical methods to draw meaningful conclusions about neonatal weight influences.
  - Implemented a multiple linear regression model, exploring beyond linear assumptions by investigating potential nonlinear effects and interactions.

## Your Experience Journey

üìä **Key Dataset Properties:**
  - The dataset includes variables such as mother's age, number of pregnancies, gestational age, and neonatal physical measurements.
  - Captures key categorical data like maternal smoking, type of delivery, hospital ID, and sex of the newborn, providing a rich basis for multivariate analysis.

üîÆ **Your Impact:**
  - Significantly advanced the field of neonatal care by identifying critical maternal and neonatal factors that predict weight at birth.
  - Enhanced decision-making tools for healthcare professionals, contributing to improved neonatal health strategies.
